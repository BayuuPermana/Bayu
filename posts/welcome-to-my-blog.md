## Hello World!

Welcome to my portfolio blog. This blog is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Markdown**.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is great because:
1. It's easy to write.
2. It's version-control friendly.
3. It keeps content separate from logic.

### My Tech Stack for this Blog
- `react-router-dom`: For client-side routing.
- `react-markdown`: To render markdown content.
- `gray-matter`: To parse frontmatter metadata.
- `tailwindcss`: For beautiful styling.

```javascript
console.log("Markdown is awesome!");
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
