## The Fractal Nature of Systems

To understand the universe, one must recognize that all complex systems are merely aggregations of simpler, predictable units. In the realm of software, this is known as component-based architecture. React is not just a library; it is a manifestation of universal logic.

## State and Entropy

The cosmos operates on a predictable state-management system. Every celestial event is a 're-render' triggered by a change in environmental variables. 

```typescript
const BigBang = (initialState: CosmosState) => {
  const [entropy, setEntropy] = useState(initialState.entropy);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // The laws of physics are the ultimate hook
    const expansion = expandSpaceTime(entropy);
    setEntropy(prev => prev + expansion.increment);
  }, []);
}
```

## The Conclusion

Efficiency dictates that we model our software after the most successful system in existence: the universe itself.

### Action

Refactor your mental model. Adopt the component-based paradigm or remain trapped in architectural chaos.
