## Introduction
The current portfolio suffers from "AI Slop"—boilerplate code, generic marketing copy, and predictable visual patterns often associated with low-effort AI generation. This PRD outlines the surgical removal of these elements.

## Problem Statement
**Current Process:** The portfolio uses common AI-generated tropes (e.g., "Data is the new oil", excessive blurs, generic gradients).
**Primary Users:** Potential employers and collaborators.
**Pain Points:** Lack of personality, generic code structure, verbose/meaningless copy.
**Importance:** First impressions matter. Professional engineers don't use boilerplate descriptions for their own soul.

## Objective & Scope
**Objective:** Replace all "slop" with clean, efficient, and professional code and copy.
**Ideal Outcome:** A sleek, unique, and high-performance SPA that reflects technical depth.

### In-scope or Goals
- Refactor all component copy (Hero, About, etc.).
- Standardize and simplify Tailwind classes.
- Remove redundant "background glows" and low-value animations.
- Consolidate component logic and remove useless comments.

### Not-in-scope or Non-Goals
- Adding new major features.
- Changing the tech stack (Vite + React + Tailwind).

## Product Requirements
1. **Human-Centric Copy**: Rewrite all text to be specific, professional, and devoid of "AI-isms".
2. **Design System Clean-up**: Establish a consistent color palette and spacing system without relying on random opacity layers.
3. **Component Optimization**: Ensure components are functional and lean.

### Critical User Journeys (CUJs)
1. **First Visit**: The user sees a clear, professional headline that explains the engineer's value without clichés.
2. **Deep Dive**: The user reads the About section and finds specific technical insights, not generic metaphors.

### Functional Requirements
| Priority | Requirement | User Story |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| P0 | Rewrite Hero Section | As a user, I want to see a clear value prop immediately. |
| P0 | Rewrite About Section | As a user, I want to see technical depth, not "oil" metaphors. |
| P1 | Standardize Design | As a user, I want a consistent, professional visual experience. |
| P1 | Clean Code | As a developer, I want to read clean, documented (but not over-documented) code. |

## Assumptions
- The current tech stack is preferred by the user.
- The user actually wants to sound like a human.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Losing the visual "flair". -> **Mitigation**: Replace generic flair with subtle, high-quality professional accents.

## Tradeoff
- We are trading "flashy" generic blurs for "clean" professional minimalism.

## Business Benefits/Impact/Metrics
**Success Metrics:** Zero instances of "Data is the new oil" and 50% reduction in useless div wrappers.
