# Research: Refactor Remaining Components

**Date**: 2026-02-17

## 1. Executive Summary
Audit of secondary components (Contact, Navigation, Projects, TechStack) to identify remaining "AI slop" patterns. Findings indicate a mix of over-the-top animations (marquee), marketing-heavy copy, and inconsistent styling flair (glows/shadows).

## 2. Technical Context
- `components/Contact.tsx`:
  - Large green shadow on primary button (`shadow-green-200`, L18).
  - Basic social icon links (L29-32).
- `components/Navigation.tsx`:
  - Gradient text logo (`bg-clip-text text-transparent`, L41).
  - Standard floating nav pattern with backdrop-blur.
- `components/Projects.tsx`:
  - Hardcoded project array (L7-46).
  - Marketing-heavy descriptions (e.g., "high-performance interface", "high-fidelity data visualization").
  - Preview images with blur-based overlays (L66).
- `components/TechStack.tsx`:
  - Marquee animation for skills (L74-82).
  - Item duplication in JSX for marquee effect.
  - "Core technical proficiencies in motion" sub-header (L53).

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- **Copy Analysis**:
  - `Projects.tsx`: Descriptions use superlatives ("high-performance", "high-fidelity") common in AI-generated templates.
  - `TechStack.tsx`: "Core technical proficiencies in motion" sounds like a generic filler phrase.
- **Styling Analysis**:
  - `TechStack.tsx`: The marquee is a high-movement element that might contrast with the "clean professional" goal.
  - `Contact.tsx`: The `shadow-green-200` on a white background (light mode) can look "cheap" or "AI-ish".
- **Logic Analysis**:
  - `TechStack.tsx`: The marquee logic is purely CSS-based but requires manual duplication of the `items` array in the JSX, which is brittle.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Must maintain Lucide React icons.
- Must respect the existing light/dark mode implementation.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Components are functional and mostly presentation-heavy.
- Hardcoded data is used throughout.
