# Description

## Problem to solve
The secondary components likely contain the same slop patterns as the primary ones.

## Solution
Audit and refactor Contact, Navigation, Projects, and TechStack. Focus on copy clarity and removing redundant Tailwind utility classes that don't add visual value.

# Discussion/Comments

- 2026-02-17 Pickle Rick: Research completed. Identified marquee animations, marketing-heavy copy in Projects, and inconsistent shadow styles.
- 2026-02-17 Pickle Rick: Refactor complete. Marquee removed, copy professionalized, and styles standardized. Done.
