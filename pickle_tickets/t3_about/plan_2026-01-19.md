# About Component Refactor Implementation Plan

## Overview
Refactor the About component to eliminate "AI Slop" copy (e.g., "Data is the new oil") and simplify the UI by removing redundant visual effects.

## Current State Analysis
- **Copy**: Generic "Data is the new oil" metaphor (L15) and vague "learner at heart" bio.
- **Visuals**: `absolute -inset-1` gradient blur (L11), unnecessary shadows.
- **Stats**: Boxy representation of GitHub stats (L36-43).

## Implementation Approach
1. **Copy Overhaul**: Replace clichés with technical narrative about hybrid data/dev engineering.
2. **Visual Simplification**: Remove the outer gradient blur; focus on clean borders and subtle depth.
3. **Layout Refinement**: Integrate stats into a more cohesive design.

## Phase 1: Copy & Technical Narrative
### Overview
Replace the tired metaphors with professional engineering context.
### Changes Required:
#### 1. `components/About.tsx`
**Changes**: Rewrite the "Hybrid Advantage" and "About Me" sections.
```typescript
// Proposed Copy:
// "Engineering at the intersection of analytical rigor and scalable software development."
// "I build systems where data isn't just stored, but actively utilized to drive application logic."
```
### Success Criteria:
#### Manual:
- [ ] No mention of "oil" or generic metaphors.

## Phase 2: UI & Styling Cleanup
### Overview
Remove redundant background blurs and simplify shadows.
### Changes Required:
#### 1. `components/About.tsx`
**Changes**: Remove the group hover gradient blur div.
```typescript
// Remove:
// <div className="absolute -inset-1 bg-gradient-to-r ... blur opacity-10 ..."></div>
```
### Success Criteria:
#### Manual:
- [ ] Section looks cleaner and more professional.

## Phase 3: Verification
### Success Criteria:
#### Automated:
- [ ] `npm run build` passes.
