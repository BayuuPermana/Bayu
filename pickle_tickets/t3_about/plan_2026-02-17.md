# [t3_about] Finish Refactoring About Component

## Overview
The About component has been partially refactored to remove "AI slop" copy, but the "Stats" section remains visually clunky ("boxy"). This plan aims to finalize the refactor by streamlining the stats and ensuring the UI is integrated and professional.

## Scope Definition (CRITICAL)
### In Scope
- Refactor the "Stats" section in `components/About.tsx`.
- Remove redundant styling and wrappers if any remain.
### Out of Scope (DO NOT TOUCH)
- Refactoring other components (Hero, Projects, etc.).
- Global CSS changes (t5_global).

## Current State Analysis
- `components/About.tsx` uses separate bordered boxes for "Repos" and "Pull Shark" stats (L37-44).
- The text content is already improved from previous iterations.

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Streamline Stats UI
- **Goal**: Make the stats section less boxy and more integrated.
- **Steps**:
  1. [x] Remove the background and border from the stat boxes.
  2. [x] Increase font size for numbers and refine typography for labels.
  3. [x] Use spacing (gap) instead of boxes to separate items.
- **Verification**: Visual check of the About section.

### Phase 2: Final Audit
- **Goal**: Ensure no remaining "slop" exists in `About.tsx`.
- **Steps**:
  1. [x] Check for redundant Tailwind classes.
  2. [x] Verify responsive layout.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` to ensure no regressions.

## Review Criteria (Self-Critique)
- Does this plan only touch the About component? Yes.
- Is it specific about the files and lines? Yes.
- Does it address the "boxy" feedback? Yes.
