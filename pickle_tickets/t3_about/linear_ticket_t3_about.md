# Description

## Problem to solve
The About section uses generic metaphors ("data is the new oil") that add zero value and sound like a template.

## Solution
1. Rewrite the "Hybrid Advantage" section to focus on actual engineering outcomes.
2. Simplify the "Stats" section (Repos, Pull Shark) to be more integrated and less "boxy".
3. Remove redundant div wrappers and background blurs.
