# Description

## Problem to solve
The Hero section is the first thing users see, and currently, it screams "low-effort AI".

## Solution
1. Rewrite the headline and sub-headline to be professional and specific.
2. Remove the "Background Glows" and redundant blur effects.
3. Clean up the Lucide icons and button styles for a more distinct look.

# Discussion/Comments

- 2026-01-19 Pickle Rick: Refactor complete. Headline updated, background glows removed, and layout streamlined. Build verified.
