# Description

## Problem to solve
The project lacks a centralized design system, leading to "class-soup" in individual components.

## Solution
1. Audit `index.css` and remove unused styles.
2. Standardize color variables (if any) and spacing.
3. Perform a final build check and audit for any remaining "AI-isms".

# Discussion/Comments

- 2026-02-17 Pickle Rick: Research completed. Identified unused marquee keyframes in index.css.
- 2026-02-17 Pickle Rick: Cleanup complete. index.css purged of dead code. Final audit confirmed consistency. Done.
