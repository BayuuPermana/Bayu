# Research: Global Cleanup and Consistency Check

**Date**: 2026-02-17

## 1. Executive Summary
Audit of global configuration and styles. The primary finding is unused animation keyframes in `index.css` following the refactor of `TechStack.tsx`. Overall codebase consistency is high following individual component refactors.

## 2. Technical Context
- `index.css`:
  - Contains `@theme` definitions for `marquee` and `marquee-reverse` (L7-21).
- `App.tsx`:
  - Standard routing and theme management logic.
- `package.json`:
  - Uses Tailwind v4 architecture with `@tailwindcss/vite` (L6).

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- **Unused CSS**:
  - The `marquee` animation defined in `index.css` is no longer referenced by any component after `TechStack.tsx` was converted to a grid.
- **Dependency Audit**:
  - Dependencies in `package.json` appear correct and utilized (e.g., `lucide-react`, `react-router-dom`).
- **Build Consistency**:
  - `vite.config.ts` correctly handles the base path for GitHub Pages deployment.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Tailwind v4.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Modern React SPA with Tailwind v4 and PostCSS.
- GitHub Pages deployment via `gh-pages`.
