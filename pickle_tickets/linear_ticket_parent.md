# Description

## Problem to solve
The portfolio is currently infested with generic AI tropes, boilerplate copy, and low-effort visual gimmicks. It lacks the professional edge required for a senior-level data/dev hybrid.

## Solution
Surgically refactor every component to remove "slop", simplify the design system, and inject professional, human-centric copy.
